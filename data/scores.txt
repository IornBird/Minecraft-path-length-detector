## Current Objectives

### Position Tracking (All values multiplied by 72 for precision)
- `dstdt_pos_x`: Current X position
  - Usage: Store player's current X coordinate
  - Notes: Updated every tick for tracked players

- `dstdt_pos_y`: Current Y position
  - Usage: Store player's current Y coordinate
  - Notes: Updated every tick for tracked players

- `dstdt_pos_z`: Current Z position
  - Usage: Store player's current Z coordinate
  - Notes: Updated every tick for tracked players

- `dstdt_prev_x`: Previous X position
  - Usage: Store player's previous X coordinate
  - Notes: Updated every tick from last pos.x

- `dstdt_prev_y`: Previous Y position
  - Usage: Store player's previous Y coordinate
  - Notes: Updated every tick from last pos.y

- `dstdt_prev_z`: Previous Z position
  - Usage: Store player's previous Z coordinate
  - Notes: Updated every tick from last pos.z

### Distance Calculation
- `dstdt_delta_x`: X coordinate difference
  - Usage: Temporary storage for position delta calculation
  - Notes: pos.x - prev.x

- `dstdt_delta_y`: Y coordinate difference
  - Usage: Temporary storage for position delta calculation
  - Notes: pos.y - prev.y

- `dstdt_delta_z`: Z coordinate difference
  - Usage: Temporary storage for position delta calculation
  - Notes: pos.z - prev.z

- `dstdt_squared`: Sum of squared deltas
  - Usage: Store x²+y²+z² before sqrt calculation
  - Notes: delta.x² + delta.y² + delta.z²

- `dstdt_const`: Constants storage
  - Usage: Store constant values (#2 for sqrt, #72 for scaling)
  - Notes: Initialized in init.mcfunction

### Newton's Method SQRT Calculation
- `dstdt_sqrt_input`: Input value for sqrt
  - Usage: Store the value we want to calculate sqrt of
  - Notes: Value is squared distance * 72²

- `dstdt_sqrt_result`: Current approximation
  - Usage: Store the current sqrt approximation
  - Notes: Initial value will be 235 (best starting point)

- `dstdt_sqrt_temp`: Temporary calculation storage
  - Usage: Store intermediate values during Newton's method
  - Notes: Used for division and averaging

### Final Results
- `dstdt_distance`: Total distance traveled
  - Usage: Accumulate total distance for each player
  - Notes: Value is in block-units * 72, divided by 72 when displaying
