# Minecraft Path Length Detector

## Overview

This project is a Minecraft datapack designed to detect and measure how far an entity (typically a player) moves in the game. It provides in-game commands to start and stop path length tracking, reporting the total movement in blocks.

This datapack is for Java edition (almost all versions supporting `execute as...`), and is NOT able to run in Bedrock edition.

## Features

- **Track Movement:** Begin and end path tracking for entities using simple chat commands.
- **Command Block Support:** Functions available for use in command blocks to automate tracking for nearby players.

**Note:** The final result may contain error, it's recommanded to use it for apporixmatation in long-path.

## Usage

### Installing
Pull it directly into your datapack folder. It will be like `<WORLD>\datapacks\`.
- Replace `<WORLD>` into path to your Minecraft map. This path can be found with:
  - Single player -> (select a world) -> Edit -> Open World Folder
- Re-open the map or type `/reload` in the chatbox before using it.

### Player Commands

- `/function dstdt:begin`  
  Start tracking the player’s movement. Records current position, resets path length to zero. Skips if already being tracked.

- `/function dstdt:end`  
  Stops tracking and reports total path length in blocks via chat. Skips if not being tracked.

### Command Block Functions

- `/function dstdt:block_begin`  
  Starts tracking for the nearest player within 5 blocks.

- `/function dstdt:block_end`  
  Ends tracking for the nearest player within 5 blocks.

## How It Works

- When tracking begins, the player’s XYZ position is stored.
- Every tick, the datapack calculates the distance moved by comparing current and previous positions.
- Path length is accumulated and rounded to the nearest integer block for reporting.
- Calculation of distances uses a recursive Newton’s method to approximate square roots efficiently in Minecraft’s scoreboard system.

## Future Work

- Automatic stop tracking when a player changes dimensions (e.g., overworld to Nether).
- Continued research into optimizing square root calculations for scoreboard constraints.

## Related Research

- Newton’s method is used for square root approximation, with a maximum recursion depth of 4 and an initial guess of 235 for best performance.
- Tested for accuracy and performance across various movement scenarios.
